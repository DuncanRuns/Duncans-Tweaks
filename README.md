# Duncan's Tweaks

An opinionated mod on tweaks for survival Minecraft.

Features:

- Re-roll village trades by re-opening their menus. Only works with villagers that haven't ever been traded with.
- Use a bed like a sleeping bag by placing it at your feet (or specifically, place it such that it would collide with yourself). This allows sleeping without setting spawn.
- Endermen picking up and placing blocks is entirely disabled. Fuck that shit.
- Changes bows to allow both mending and infinity, because why bother dealing with Mojang's poor attempt at balancing enchantments?
